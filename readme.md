#Trial
Just a trial repo where I experiment with git and biicode tags.

#1. Appveyor
    - not build commit matching pattern -> working
    - if tag logic:
        + if no tag -> just publish without tag
        + if tag -> publish stable
#2. Perfect Environment variables
   - done
#3. PowerShell scripting
    - if no tag -> publish as dev 
    - if tag -> update biicode parents
#4. PowerShell compares and releases push if updated parents
    - Trying to launch commit with power shell scripting
    - move-item -literalpath added
    - just enviroment variables trial
    - env trial working
    - if checking
